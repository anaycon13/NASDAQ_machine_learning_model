# NASDAQ_machine_learning_model
Authors: Thor Mead, Arya Bhansali, and Anay Contractor

We developed a machine learning model to predict NASDAQ movements using alternative data. We first aim to backtest this model, then see if we can extrapolate it for future events. The goal is to see if non-traditional financial data (credit card balances, web traffic, loan delinquencies, consumer price indices, etc.) can be used to create statistically significant models for stock market analysis and prediction. Eventually, we would hope to increase the number of relevant variables, search for new parameters, and strengthen the mathematical and statistical foundations of our model. I have attached Jupyter Notebooks with the relevant code as well the CSV files that contain the raw data we used.
